      <H1>About Me</H1>
      <hr>
      <img id="bioimg" src="assets/images/james.jpg">
      My name is James and I'm from Austin, TX.  I've always been naturally good at computers and other technology, and
      have practiced coding in one form or another since I was 7 years old.  I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp through
      GWU that is helping me polish the knowledge I already have.  I am really excited to show you some of the things
      I am capable of, but before any of that i need to give my cat an honorable mention.  His name is Willy, and me
      and my girlfriend rescued him from a dilapidated house when we were in Wilmington, NC.  He is completely black,
      even his heart, and he is the most destructive force I have ever encountered.  I am not normally a cat person,
      but I feel no choice but to respect Willy's shameless stance opposing anything ordered or valuable.<BR>
      Anyways, enjoy my portfolio!
